# pandos
A tiny x86 from-scratch BIOS operating system that I wrote for fun, and to learn about x86 operating systems. It's very small and doesn't do much. It compiles with Clang/LLVM and runs in Bochs/QEMU/VMWare. 

# What do I do with this?
Just a simple little project, obviously never intended for any real use.
